rodash
======

The goodness of lodash wrapped in Ruby and Rails conventions for your comfort.

Tired of calling `_` everywhere in your code? And remembering what the function names are?
Now you don't have to. Use the Ruby and Rails idioms that feel so much better.

No more:

``` coffee
_.map [1, 2, 3], (num) -> num * 3
```

Now you can:

``` coffee
[1, 2, 3].map (num) -> num * 3
```

More later...
